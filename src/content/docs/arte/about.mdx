So, what does it do? Simple! Let's say you have a BIG server resource pack.
Every time you make a little change, you will have to manually re-host it somewhere, and players will have to fully re-download it.
This can get annoying. Arte splits the resource pack into parts (by namespaces), hosts it directly on your server
and sends each one as a different server resource pack!
> Q: How is this possible? There can only be one server resource pack loaded at one time!

> A: In 1.20.3 Mojang added a new feature that allows servers to send multiple server resource packs at a time!

Players will only re-download the parts that actually need updating, and apply other server packs.
:::tip
Arte can be combined with [Resource Pack Tweaks][rptweaks-url] mod for best server resource pack behaviour
